Given an integer array `nums`, return *the number of longest increasing subsequences.*

**Notice** that the sequence has to be **strictly** increasing.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,3,5,4,7\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The two longest increasing subsequences are \[1, 3, 4, 7\] and \[1, 3, 5, 7\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,2,2,2,2\]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The length of the longest increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 increasing subsequences of length 1, so output 5.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= nums.length <= 2000`
-   `-106 <= nums[i] <= 106`
